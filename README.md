# Java labs for CCPS 109

Weekly lab problems from the discontinued Java version of CCPS 109, as taught by [Ilkka Kokkarinen](https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~ikokkari/) between the years 2002 and 2018 for the Chang School of Continuing Education, Ryerson University, Toronto. In 2018, the course was switched to Python in the CS curriculum.

Each week's lab comes with the corresponding JUnit test class that fuzz tests each method with a bunch of pseudorandomly generated data, calculates a checksum of the results and compares this checksum to the expected checksum that was produced by the instructor's model solution. These model solutions are also included in this repository.

The repository also includes the tester framework and the instructor's model solution for the Snowman player programming project used during one semester of teaching this course in the daytime. (Snowman is what used to be traditionally called Hangman, but as you now, it is the Current Year.) Several first year students produced solutions that beat the instructor's model solution, and like The Love Boat, this project promises something for everyone at all initial levels of skill and problem solving aptitude.

All computer science instructors still using Java as their teaching language are encouraged to freely use and adapt these labs. All source code is released undel GNU GPL v3.
